It is inspired by two algorithms for average consensus already present in the literature, one which deals with asynchronous but reliable communication and the other which deals with unreliable but synchronous communication. We show that the proposed algorithm is exponentially convergent under mild assumptions regarding the nodes update frequency and the link failures. The theoretical results are complemented with numerical simulations."

This means that the monitoring and control of these networks and the transfer of packets from the IoT network to the server can cause communications to collapse. On the other hand, due to the large volume of data stored in the databases the monitoring of the IoT network needs very powerful servers to have a high degree of efficiency. This paper presents a novel adaptive closed-loop control system and speed up searches model to improve the monitor and control efficiency in IoT networks, specially those which are based in blockchain. The non linear control model under consideration includes a new way to evaluate the optimal number of blocks that should be at the queue of the miners’ network in order to make the process efficient through the use of queuing theory. Also, a new system to speed up searches is presented by using hashmaps, which makes the monitoring process faster, reliable and efficient. The efficiency of the presented approach is illustrated by a numerical case study."

These agents operate on behalf of users that need services; for these reason agents are often in competition with each other. On the other hand, an agent can often benefit from collaborating with other agents in some circumstances, exchanging information and services. Under this viewpoint, the task of finding the best partners to collaborate is a key task for an agent. A general consensus exists about the benefits deriving by forming friendships and groups for mutual cooperation inside competitive Multi-Agent Systems (MASs). In this respect, the existing proposals are usually addressed to maximize the profit at the level of individual agent or group. Unfortunately, the most part of these approaches could advantage the most aggressive agents, also in presence of bad social behaviors. This is not a desired scenario in a smart city environment. A possible solution to this problem is that of promoting correct behaviors and meritocracy inside agent communities. To this aim, we propose to model the competitive MAS scenario in the framework of non cooperative games by assuming to represent (i) the trustworthiness of agents relationships by means of a trust model and (ii) the capability of a community to provide its members with a good environment by means of its social capital. As a result, a group formation algorithm capable to asymptotically maximize the social capital is proposed. This algorithm highlights two main features: (i) the computed solution is a Nash equilibrium in the considered game and (ii) the only rewarded agents are those having the most correct behaviors."

Our main concerns are related to optimize the network latency, the service spread and the use of the resources. The algorithms are evaluated with a random Barabasi–Albert network topology with 100 devices and with two experiment sizes of 100 and 200 application services. The results showed that NSGA-II obtained the highest optimizations of the objectives and the highest diversity of the solution space. On the contrary, MOEA/D was better to reduce the execution times.

Moreover, the concept of speaking and hearing objects further advanced the level of interactions occurring among the IoT devices by empowering them with conversational abilities. Researchers are constantly working to practically realize this vision, keeping in mind the potential benefits of the integration of technologies like argumentation, logical reasoning and artificial intelligence into IoT. Moving along the same lines, this paper investigates the emerging concept of speaking objects and proposes novel reference architecture for argumentation enabled Social IoT systems. The proposed framework lays out a theoretical foundation for development of future applications in the said domain. Further, to overcome the challenges of conflict resolution in argumentation-based decision making, a game theoretic weighted voting scheme is deployed. To ascertain the validity the proposed model, a smart home assisted living use-case scenario is simulated in MATLAB. The simulations are conducted for both weighted and non-weighted voting schemes in a 4-player cooperative game and their performance is evaluated. Experimental results revealed that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing non-weighted voting schemes in terms of throughput which is improved by 35."

In this paper, the optimal topology is obtained irrespective of the agent dynamics by using two-dimensional Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is a new approach in this context.

Consensus algorithms are the flagship of distributed control and find application in solving problems as varied as distributed task assignment, distributed estimation, and distributed optimization. Unfortunately, typical consensus algorithms deteriorate their performance when faced with realistic communication phenomena as asynchronous communications, packet losses and channel delays. In this work, an algorithm for achieving average consensus over an IoT environment is introduced and evaluated extensively in a large-scale IoT testbed. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves average consensus in all evaluated scenarios despite heterogeneity in the network in terms of processing and networking capabilities, packet losses and delays."

Existing consensus methods used in blockchain require high energy consumption, massive computational power with trusted authorities, or proof for mining a block. Resource constrained IoT devices need a lightweight and low latency consensus mechanism. Trust-free probabilistic consensus methods allow every node to participate in the consensus, enhancing the robustness and reliability of transactions as compared to absolute consensus methods. We propose a lightweight probabilistic proof of elapsed work and luck (PoEWAL) consensus method for non-cooperative blockchain in IoT environments. PoEWAL consumes less energy, requires less computational power and has low latency. We analyzed suitability of PoEWAL for resource constrained devices, using Contiki Cooja simulator. Experimental results show that energy consumption is low at various difficulty levels, demonstrating the feasibility of PoEWAL. Furthermore, PoEWAL is compared with such existing probabilistic consensus methods as proof of work, proof of stake, proof of activity, algorand, and proof of authority, in terms of energy, consensus time, and network latency, to confirm that PoEWAL is a suitable consensus method for blockchain in IoT."

Research in the Internet of Things have concentrated their efforts on how to monitor these devices taking into account both scalability and efficiency while searching and updating continuously device information. In order to do that, current alternatives combine a widely recognized method, the data aggregation, and a widely adopted distributed structure, called Distributed Hash Table, which form groups of devices, saving energy by minimizing the number of transmissions. However, scalability is still a key challenge when the group comprises a large number of devices. In this paper, we propose a scalable architecture that creates agents to distribute the responsibility of managing groups and the interaction among them, such as merging and splitting, and shares the data aggregation with the devices of group frontier. Experimental results showed the viability of adopting this architecture if compared to the most widely used current approaches."

The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other areas are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to data manipulation attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not suitable for resource-constrained systems. In this article, we survey the various blockchain-based consensus methods that are applicable to resource-constrained IoT devices and networks. In a typical IoT network, there exist several devices with limited computational and communication capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain, such as private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain-based IoT network. Some of the open research challenges including AI-enabled blockchains are also put forward."

Different from the existing results, both the consensus analysis and the transient performance characteristics for high-order linear MASs are considered. Based on a factorization of Laplacian matrix, the initial MAS is firstly transformed into the so-called weighted edge dynamics, and then a design equivalence between the proposed PID consensus controller and the corresponding stabilizing controller for such weighted edge dynamics is presented via some graph theory results. Furthermore, by combining Lyapunov theory and Barbalat’s Lemma, it is proved that both the stabilization of weighted edge dynamics and the consensus of MAS can be guaranteed even in the presence of external disturbances. In particular, some relationships between the transient time performance of weighted edge dynamics and the PID design parameters are given. Finally, some numerical examples on LC oscillator network are provided to illustrate the validity of theoretical results."

The key idea behind MEC is to enhance the capabilities of mobile devices by forwarding the computation of applications to the edge of the network instead of to a cloud data-center. One of the main challenges in MEC is determining an efficient placement of the components of a mobile application on the edge servers that minimizes the cost incurred when running the application. In this paper, we address the problem of multi-component application placement in edge computing by designing an efficient heuristic on-line algorithm that solves it. We also present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation of the multi-component application placement problem that takes into account the dynamic nature of users' location and the network capabilities. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has very small execution time and obtains near optimal solutions.},

While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, various consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result existing proposals are sometimes misunderstood and it is often unclear whether the problems arising during their executions are due to implementation bugs or more fundamental design issues. In this paper, we discuss the mainstream blockchain consensus algorithms and how the classic Byzantine consensus can be revisited for the blockchain context. In particular, we discuss proof-of-work consensus and illustrate the differences between the Bitcoin and the Ethereum proof-of-work consensus algorithms. Based on these definitions, we warn about the dangers of using these blockchains without understanding precisely the guarantees their consensus algorithm offers. In particular, we survey attacks against the Bitcoin and the Ethereum consensus algorithms. We finally discuss the advantage of the recent Blockchain Byzantine consensus definition over previous definitions, and the promises offered by emerging consistent blockchains."

In this paper, we design seven such applications and evaluate their performance in terms of latency across a range of edge computing configurations, mobile hardware, and wireless networks, including 4G LTE. We also devise a novel multi-algorithm approach that leverages temporal locality to reduce end-to-end latency by 60% to 70%, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we derive target latencies for our applications, and show that edge computing is crucial to meeting these targets.},

abstract = "Recently, blockchain technology has been used to address the security issues of Internet of things (IoT) applications. However, some issues particular to blockchain should be solved to meet the security requirements of IoT systems. The core of blockchain technology is distributed computing, along with the collaboration mechanism of group trust under the distributed computing environment, which can solve the scalability, collaboration ability, trust relationship, and security protection challenges faced by the IoT. The existing blockchain consensus protocol can only solve the trust cooperation problem with limited credibility. Although distributed trust relationship management has advantages over centralized trust relationship management, several risks exist. Here, the most critical issue is the credibility of the blockchain consensus protocol. Based on the characteristics of the traditional public chain, we propose a repute-based consensus protocol for blockchain-enabled IoT systems. In the protocol, two methods are designed to enable the blockchain system to reach a consensus rapidly and safely. The repute rewards and punishments method settles the repute values of nodes; nodes with satisfactory behavior receive repute rewards. The repute mining method proposes repute requirements for consensus nodes; nodes with high repute value produce blocks more easily. Security analysis has been conducted using a theory model and experimental evaluation. The establishment of our repute system can improve the consensus protocol, resisting stronger attacks, and giving several users with lower computing power a greater opportunity to participate in consensus. The experimental results show that the repute-based consensus protocol has advantages in terms of security and that its resistance capability against attacks is improved."

abstract = {Many applications in low-power wireless networks require complex coordination between their members. Swarms of robots or sensors and actuators in industrial closed-loop control need to coordinate within short periods of time to execute tasks. Failing to agree on a common decision can cause substantial consequences, like system failures and threats to human life. Such applications require consensus algorithms to enable coordination. While consensus has been studied for wired networks decades ago, with, for example, Paxos and Raft, it remains an open problem in multi-hop low-power wireless networks due to the limited resources available and the high cost of established solutions. This paper presents Wireless Paxos, a fault-tolerant, network-wide consensus primitive for low-power wireless networks. It is a new flavor of Paxos, the most-used consensus protocol today, and is specifically designed to tackle the challenges of low-power wireless networks. By building on top of concurrent transmissions, it provides low-latency, high reliability, and guarantees on the consensus. Our results show that Wireless Paxos requires only 289 ms to complete a consensus between 188 nodes in testbed experiments. Furthermore, we show that Wireless Paxos stays consistent even when injecting controlled failures.},

abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},
